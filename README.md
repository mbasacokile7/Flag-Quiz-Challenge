# The Flag Quiz Challenge
---------------------------------------
The purpose of this challenge is to apply concepts learned about PosgreSQL. 
The main idea was to be able to use pgAdim, to create dattabases and also create tables. 
In addition, data from external sources, such as downloaded csv files were uploaded to tables.
NodeJS, Express, body-parser and pg npm packages were used to enable the full functionality.

## Functionality
-------------------------------------------
1. On the landing page, the user would see a flag of a random country.
2. The user is provided an input element, where they write the country that has the displayed flag.
3. The user data, would then be verfied in the back to see if the answer is correct.
4. If the anser is correct, then another flag would be dislplayed, If not, the suer would have to reload the page.
